# Insertion Sort
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(1)

Insertion Sort takes in an unsorted array and return 
a sorted one. It starts with the index 1 and compare
the values in index 0 and 1. If the value at 0 is 
larger than the value at 1, it will swap the two, move 
on to continue this pattern. a counter i and j is kept 
track in a while loop.

This can also be implemented with a recursion.
