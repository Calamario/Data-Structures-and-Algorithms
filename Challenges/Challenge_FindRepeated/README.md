# HashTable - Repeated Word
To further our knowledge on data structures and algorithms, we will be manipulating Hash Tables.

## Challenge
Given a length string of text. Find the first word that is repeated. 
You can assume no punctuation.

## Solution

My solution not only assumes that there is no punctuation but equal 
spacing between the words and returns an empty string if the repeated 
word is not there
