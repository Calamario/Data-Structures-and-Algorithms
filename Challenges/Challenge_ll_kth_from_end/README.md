# Linked Lists - Kth Element
To further our knowledge on data structures and algorithms, we will be manipulating linked lists

## Challenge
Write a method in the LinkList Class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the Node that is kth from the end of the linked list. 

## Solution

![LL_KthElement](../../assets/LL_KthElement_Visual.jpg)

## Code
Our Whiteboard solution and coded out versions are different. After more time, we found that having another node reference "runner" much like current will help reduce the Big O for time. Thus optimzing our solution.
