# Linked Lists - Merge  List
To further our knowledge on data structures and algorithms, we will be manipulating linked lists

## Challenge
Write a method in the LinkList Class which takes two Linked List and merges them together, by alternating between the nodes. Return the Head node from the merged list.

## Solution

![merged](../../assets/merge_list_visual.jpg)

## Code
Our Whiteboarding had and error when it came to our edge cases for when the first Link List was longer than the second one. We now have solved this issue by adding a conditional after the while loop to run code specific to possible edge cases
