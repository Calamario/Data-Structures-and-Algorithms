# Linked Lists
Introduction to understanding Linked List.

## What Is It?
Linked Lists are a type of data structure. It is comprised of Nodes. Nodes consist of two property, a Value and a Next. The property Next points to the following node. Traversing through a Linked List uses a While loop


## Challenge
Implement the Link list by creating a Node and LinkList class. Within the LinkList class, create the following methods.
* Add - O(1) add a Node before the Head of the Linked List
* Find - O(n) given a value, find if the node with the given value exists.
* Print - O(n) prints out the Link List to console
* AddBefore - O(n) add a Node before an existing Node
* AddAfter - O(n) add a Node after an existing Node
* AddLast - O(n) add a Node at the end of the Linked List
We were not allowed to use methods that are available through Visual Studio.
Create a Node class, LinkList class, and unit testing to see if functionality is valid
