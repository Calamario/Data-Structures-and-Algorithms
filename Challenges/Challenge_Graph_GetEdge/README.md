# Graph GetEdges
To further our knowledge on data structures and algorithms, we will be manipulating Graphs.

## Challenge
Create a method called GetEdges that takes in a graph and two locations. 
Return if the two locations are in the graph and if they are connected by 
a direct flight. If they are return true and the cost(weight) of travel, if 
not return false and 0. If the locations are not on the graph return null

## Code
The code implemented to find the solution is not the same the as whiteboard
solution. I tried implementing the Graph as a linked list and tried not 
using a dictionary for the solution.
