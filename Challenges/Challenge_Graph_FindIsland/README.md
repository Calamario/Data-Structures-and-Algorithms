# Graph FindIsland
To further our knowledge on data structures and algorithms, we will be manipulating Graphs.

## Challenge
Create a method called FindIsland that takes in an adjacency matrix 
and returns a int of how many island there are in the graph. 


## Solution

![solution](../../assets/graph_findisland_visual.jpg)


## Code
The code implemented to find the solution is slightly wrong. There are
currently cases where the method fails to return the correct number of
island
