# Stacks and Queue - Multi-Bracket
To further our knowledge on data structures and algorithms, we will be manipulating Stacks and Queues.

## Challenge
Create a method that takes in a string and and returns a boolean. True if the string
constains equal numbers of opening and closing brackets and false if not. 
There are three types of brackets: (), {}, []. The opening and closing must 
be of the same type of bracket.


## Solution

## Code
After implementing the code, worked on a method using stacks with peers.
This code is commented out after the implemented code.
