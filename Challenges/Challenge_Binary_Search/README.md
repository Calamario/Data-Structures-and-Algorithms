# Binary Search Problem
For this problem, we needed to write a method that takes in two parameters, a sorted array and a key, and returns the index of the element that is equal to the key or -1 if the if match exists. 

## Challenge
We were not allowed to use methods that are available through Visual Studio

## Solution
